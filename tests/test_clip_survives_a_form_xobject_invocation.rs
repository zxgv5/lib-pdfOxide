//! The clipping path in force at `Do` also bounds the form's content.
//!
//! ISO 32000-1:2008 §8.10.2 lists what invoking a form XObject does to the
//! graphics state, and clipping to the form's `/BBox` is *in addition to*
//! what is already in force. §8.5.4 makes clipping cumulative: a new clipping
//! path "shall be intersected with the current clipping path". Nothing in
//! either clause lets a form escape the clip that was set before it.
//!
//! The renderer tracked the clip in a stack local to `execute_operators` and
//! passed it to the image branch of `Do` but not to the form branch, so the
//! form was rendered with only its own `/BBox`. A form whose `/BBox` covers
//! the page, invoked inside a small `re W n`, therefore painted across
//! everything the clip existed to exclude.
//!
//! Producers rely on this: a logo drawn by a shared form whose box spans the
//! whole sheet is routinely clipped down to its corner at the call site.
