//! A two-column body with a full-measure ruled table across it still reads
//! down each column.
//!
//! A regulation page sets its text in two narrow columns and interrupts them
//! with a table whose rules and caption run the full measure. The table is
//! genuine and is detected. But the page then met a predicate that decides
//! whether a page's multi-column signal comes from its table alone by keeping
//! the MINIMUM left edge of each row band, and on a two-column page that
//! minimum is the left column's margin on every band — the right column is
//! never seen. It declared the signal tabular and the page was sorted
//! row-aware, reading the two columns straight across:
//!
//! ```text
//! must be designed and constructed to  | warning devices must be config-
//! prevent contamination of the ...     | ured so that they may not be ...
//! ```
//!
//! came out as `must be config-` / `prevent contamination of the` / `ured so
//! that`, so the wrapped word can never be rejoined and `configured` is gone
//! from the page.
//!
//! The column branches decline such a page for a good reason — the table's
//! rows and its centred caption straddle the gutter, so there is no clean
//! corridor — and the untagged fallback is the content stream's own order
//! (ISO 32000-1:2008 §14.8.2.3, page content order), which a two-column page
//! writes column-major. The row-aware override is withheld whenever the prose
//! outside the tables starts at exactly two column positions.
//!
//! The counter-case is a single-column page with the same table: its cells
//! still trip the multi-column detector, and the row-aware sort is still the
//! right answer there, so the override must survive for it.
