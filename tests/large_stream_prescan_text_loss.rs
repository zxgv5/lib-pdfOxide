//! End-to-end: crossing the content-stream size at which span extraction
//! switches to pre-scanning for text regions must not change the text a page
//! yields.
//!
//! Above that size the extractor locates text regions and replays each one
//! with a reconstructed graphics state instead of parsing the stream front to
//! back. Both fixtures here are shapes taken from real CAD/plan sheets, where
//! the stream is one long line of `cm`-scaled marked-content blocks:
//!
//!   * a marked-content block that scales the CTM between text objects — the
//!     region is extended back over its `BDC`, so the operators between the
//!     `BDC` and the `BT` are replayed on top of the injected state and the
//!     scale applies twice, putting the text far outside the MediaBox where
//!     the off-page filter deletes it;
//!   * a sheet whose text lives in re-used Form XObjects, where `Do`
//!     invocations outnumber page-level `BT` blocks.
//!
//! Each is asserted against the same page built under the threshold, so the
//! fixtures pin "the size of the surrounding linework must not matter" rather
//! than any particular extraction quality.
