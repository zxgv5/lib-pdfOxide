//! An absolute repositioning that skips a gap ends a glyph run, exactly as a
//! relative one does.
//!
//! ISO 32000-1:2008 §9.4.2, Table 108 gives `Tm` and `Td` the same effect: both
//! set the text matrix and the text line matrix, differing only in whether the
//! displacement is absolute or relative to the current line matrix. A
//! displacement that ends a run of contiguous glyphs for one operator must end
//! it for the other — run continuity is a property of the resulting pen
//! position, not of the operator that moved the pen.
//!
//! The extractor batches `Tm`+`Tj` pairs into one span, which is what keeps a
//! PDF that positions every glyph individually from producing thousands of
//! one-character spans. That test required the same line, the same transform
//! and forward progression, but placed no bound on *how far* forward: a jump
//! into the next column was accepted as a continuation, so two show operations
//! separated by empty space were glued into a single span with no separator
//! and a width spanning the gap between them.
//!
//! Downstream that costs more than a missing space. Anything reasoning about a
//! span's extent — table-cell ownership, column detection, reading order —
//! sees one span straddling the gap, and a cell can no longer claim the text
//! drawn inside it.
