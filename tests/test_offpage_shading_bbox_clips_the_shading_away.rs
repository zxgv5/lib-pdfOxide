//! A shading `/BBox` that cannot be rasterized is resolved in the direction
//! that paints *less*, not more.
//!
//! Table 78 makes a shading's `/BBox` a clip in the shading's target space.
//! When its device bounds exceed what `f32` can represent, the renderer cannot
//! build a mask for it — and the two ways that happens are opposites:
//!
//! * bounds that are merely enormous but still **reach the page** restrict
//!   nothing visible, so discarding the box is harmless;
//! * bounds placed wholly **off-page** exclude everything, so discarding the
//!   box paints the entire shading the file asked to be hidden.
//!
//! §8.5.4: content outside the clipping path shall not be painted. Annex C.1
//! licenses *having* an arithmetic limit; it does not license resolving past
//! one in the direction that paints more.
//!
//! Both directions are asserted, because a renderer that simply drops every
//! unrasterizable shading passes the off-page case for the wrong reason.
//!
//! The coordinates are written out in full rather than as `1e9`: ISO 32000-1
//! §7.3.3 does not permit exponential notation for a real, so a `1e9` in the
//! file never parses and the whole `/BBox` is silently ignored. That produced a
//! convincing-looking failure that was entirely the fixture's fault.
