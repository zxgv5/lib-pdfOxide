//! A ruled table's cells appear exactly once on every surface.
//!
//! Three rules used to decide whether a span belonged to a table and they
//! disagreed: the detector claimed a span by its bbox **centre** with a 3 pt
//! snap over populated cells, while the converters claimed by the span's
//! **origin** with a 2 pt slack over the full lattice. A span caught one way
//! was rendered by the cell *and* emitted in the prose flow; caught the other
//! way it was suppressed from prose and rendered by nobody.
//!
//! Ownership is now answered from what the table actually renders — marked
//! content where the file is tagged, the cells' own spans otherwise — so both
//! directions resolve together. See `span_in_table` in
//! `src/pipeline/converters/mod.rs`.
//!
//! The fixture is deliberately trivial: four cells and six stroked rules. The
//! defect reproduced here, so it was never an edge case.
