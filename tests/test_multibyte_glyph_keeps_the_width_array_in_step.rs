//! One advance per glyph, however many bytes the glyph's character occupies.
//!
//! `TextSpan::char_widths` carries one entry per character of `text`, and its
//! consumers index it that way — the span's extent is the sum of it, and the
//! word-gap tests measure from that extent. It was filled by asking how much
//! the accumulating buffer had grown, but that buffer is a `String`, so the
//! answer was in **bytes**. An em dash is three bytes of UTF-8 and one
//! character, so it contributed three entries of a third of its advance each,
//! and from that point on every glyph in the run carried a neighbour's width.
//!
//! ISO 32000-1:2008 §9.4.4 gives each glyph a single displacement along the
//! writing axis. The array holds those displacements, so it has exactly as
//! many entries as the text has characters.
//!
//! The consequence is not visible in the characters — `extract_chars` reads
//! measured origins, not this array — but the span's own extent falls short by
//! whatever the misalignment loses, and a gap appears at the end of the run
//! where the page has none.
