//! A table cell must not re-decide word joins the span-level merger already

//!
//! A producer that draws one word as several show operations, repositioning
//! between them with sub-em gaps (declared glyph widths understating the true
//! pen steps), puts the cell text builder in a position no gap threshold can
//! win from. The fixture below reproduces that inversion exactly:
//!
//!   intra-word seam, must NOT become a space :  1.75 pt
//!   real word space, must     become a space :  1.53 pt
//!
//! The seam is WIDER than the legitimate space, so no constant separates
//! them: a threshold high enough to keep "Credit" whole (>= 1.75) also
//! swallows the space before "<", and one low enough to keep that space
//! (< 1.53) also splits "Credit". Only the source-order evidence tells them
//! apart — the space is a space GLYPH occupying its own character position,
//! while the seam is pure repositioning between consecutive glyphs. The
//! span-level merger reads that evidence and joins correctly, so table
//! extraction must consume its verdict rather than re-derive the join from
//! raw bbox gaps.
