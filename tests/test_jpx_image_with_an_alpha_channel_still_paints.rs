//! A JPEG 2000 image carrying an opacity channel still paints.
//!
//! A JPX codestream may hold an alpha channel beside its colour channels, so a
//! greyscale image decodes to two components rather than one. ISO 32000-1:2008
//! Table 89's `/SMaskInData` entry (`docs/spec/pdf.md`:14527) governs that
//! channel, and its default is 0:
//!
//! > **0** If present, encoded soft-mask image information shall be ignored.
//!
//! How many of the decoded components are colour is settled by the same
//! table's `/ColorSpace` entry (pdf.md:14487): "If **ColorSpace** is present,
//! any colour space specifications in the JPEG2000 data shall be ignored."
//! `/DeviceGray` therefore means one colour component and one to discard.
//!
//! The decoder used to reject any component count it did not recognise, so a
//! two-component image failed to extract, the `Do` was skipped, and the page
//! rendered **completely white** — total content loss. One real file is a
//! single 551x337 grey+alpha JPX covering its whole page; all four reference
//! engines paint it and we painted nothing.
//!
//! The fixture is generated, not taken from a report: a 16x16 grey+alpha JP2
//! written by OpenJPEG, holding a light square on a dark ground.
