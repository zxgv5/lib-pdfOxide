        //
        //   By setting a shading pattern as the current colour in the graphics
        //   state, a PDF content stream may use it with painting operators
        //   such as f (fill), S (stroke), Tj (show text) ... to paint a path,
        //   character glyph, or mask with a smooth colour transition. When a
        //   shading is used in this way, the geometry of the gradient fill is
        //   independent of that of the object being painted.
        //
        // So the gradient is required, not optional: painting a solid colour
        // instead is a wrong result, not an approximation. It was also a
        // silently bad one — the fallback paints `fill_color_components`, and
        // a coloured pattern is selected by `/P0 scn` with *no* operands, so
        // there are no components and the stale fill colour is used. In a
        // stream whose first colour operator is that `scn`, the stale colour
        // is the initial black, and a pale gradient rendered as a black flood.
        //
        // Table 77 (pdf.md:12929) fixes the coordinate frame: unlike `sh`,
        // whose coordinates are in current user space, "when a shading
        // dictionary is used in a type 2 pattern, the coordinates are
